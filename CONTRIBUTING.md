First of all, thank you for contributing. Itâ€™s appreciated.

# To submit a pull request

1. Open a GitHub issue before doing significant amount of work.
2. Clone the repo. If it was already cloned, then git pull to get the latest from master.
4. Make sure to have yarn installed on your system.
3. Run `yarn run setup` before anything else, and wait.
6. Write code.
7. Write test (coverage regressions will fail the build). Run test with `yarn test`. 
9. Make a pull request against the master branch.
